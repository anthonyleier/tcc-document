Even when using automated unit tests, such tests rarely cover all interesting cases of code, which means that a bug could never be discovered, once the code is tested against the same set of rules over and over again. This paper addresses the problem of generating random well-typed programs in the context of Featherweight Java, a well-known object-oriented calculus, using QuickCheck, a Haskell library for property-based testing."

    abstract = "{Deep learning (DL) is a branch of machine learning (ML) showing increasing promise in medicine, to assist in data classification, novel disease phenotyping and complex decision making. Deep learning is a form of ML typically implemented via multi-layered neural networks. Deep learning has accelerated by recent advances in computer hardware and algorithms and is increasingly applied in e-commerce, finance, and voice and image recognition to learn and classify complex datasets. The current medical literature shows both strengths and limitations of DL. Strengths of DL include its ability to automate medical image interpretation, enhance clinical decision-making, identify novel phenotypes, and select better treatment pathways in complex diseases. Deep learning may be well-suited to cardiovascular medicine in which haemodynamic and electrophysiological indices are increasingly captured on a continuous basis by wearable devices as well as image segmentation in cardiac imaging. However, DL also has significant weaknesses including difficulties in interpreting its models (the ‘black-box’ criticism), its need for extensive adjudicated (‘labelled’) data in training, lack of standardization in design, lack of data-efficiency in training, limited applicability to clinical trials, and other factors. Thus, the optimal clinical application of DL requires careful formulation of solvable problems, selection of most appropriate DL algorithms and data, and balanced interpretation of results. This review synthesizes the current state of DL for cardiovascular clinicians and investigators, and provides technical context to appreciate the promise, pitfalls, near-term challenges, and opportunities for this exciting new area.}",

abstract = {Distance learning is different from regular learning in the classroom. One of the main factors which influence the effectiveness of the learning process is the interaction that exists between the teacher and the student. Our research indicates that different interactions have different effects. There are two methods used for implementing distance learning systems, i.e. synchronous and asynchronous. Our research is based on the model developed by Oliver and McLaughlin. According to this model, there exist five types of teacher–student interactions: social, procedural, expository, explanatory and cognitive. The present study refers to the cognitive interaction and differentiates between surface processes and deep processes. The study presents different variables and their influences on the students’ achievements and their satisfaction from learning via a synchronous versus an asynchronous distance learning system. The interaction level between the students and the teacher and among the students was found to be a significant factor in determining the effectiveness of the teaching method. The observations and interviews which we held with the students helped clarify the information that was obtained using the quantitative research tools, and showed that the presence of a teacher–student interaction which accompanies the learning process is very important for all learners. However, students with high-level thinking can overcome the low-level of interactions in asynchronous learning.}

abstract = {An essential requirement for a successful circular economy is the continuous use of materials. Planning for building materials reuse at the end-of-life of buildings is usually a difficult task because limited time are usually made available for building removal and materials recovery. In this study, deep learning models were developed for predicting the amount (in tons) of salvage and waste materials that are obtainable from buildings at the end-of-life prior to demolition. Datasets used for deep neural network model developments were extracted from 2280 building demolition records obtained from the practitioners in the UK Demolition Industry. The data was partitioned into training, testing and validation datasets in the ratio 8:1:1. Deep learning models were developed with a deep learning framework in R programming environment. The average R-squared value for the three deep learning models is 0.97 with Mean Absolute Error between 17.93 and 19.04. The models were evaluated with four scenarios of a case study building design. The results of the evaluation show that, given basic features of buildings, it is possible to predict with a high level of accuracy, the amount of materials that would be recovered from a building after demolition. The models developed will provide decision support functionalities to demolition engineers and waste management planners during the pre-demolition audit exercise.}

abstract = {Precise item categorization is a key issue in e-commerce domains. However, it still remains a challenging problem due to data size, category skewness, and noisy metadata. Here, we demonstrate a successful report on a deep learning-based item categorization method, i.e., deep categorization network (DeepCN), in an e-commerce website. DeepCN is an end-to-end model using multiple recurrent neural networks (RNNs) dedicated to metadata attributes for generating features from text metadata and fully connected layers for classifying item categories from the generated features. The categorization errors are propagated back through the fully connected layers to the RNNs for weight update in the learning process. This deep learning-based approach allows diverse attributes to be integrated into a common representation, thus overcoming sparsity and scalability problems. We evaluate DeepCN on large-scale real-world data including more than 94 million items with approximately 4,100 leaf categories from a Korean e-commerce website. Experiment results show our method improves the categorization accuracy compared to the model using single RNN as well as a standard classification model using unigram-based bag-of-words. Furthermore, we investigate how much the model parameters and the used attributes influence categorization performances.},

    abstract = {Since 2006, deep learning (DL) has become a rapidly growing research direction, redefining state-of-the-art performances in a wide range of areas such as object recognition, image segmentation, speech recognition and machine translation. In modern manufacturing systems, data-driven machine health monitoring is gaining in popularity due to the widespread deployment of low-cost sensors and their connection to the Internet. Meanwhile, deep learning provides useful tools for processing and analyzing these big machinery data. The main purpose of this paper is to review and summarize the emerging research work of deep learning on machine health monitoring. After the brief introduction of deep learning techniques, the applications of deep learning in machine health monitoring systems are reviewed mainly from the following aspects: Auto-encoder (AE) and its variants, Restricted Boltzmann Machines and its variants including Deep Belief Network (DBN) and Deep Boltzmann Machines (DBM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). In addition, an experimental study on the performances of these approaches has been conducted, in which the data and code have been online. Finally, some new trends of DL-based machine health monitoring methods are discussed.}
